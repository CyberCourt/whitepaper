# CyberCourt
> **A fair judgment indirectly proves the existence of the voice of God.**

In many parts of the world, legal costs remain high and judicial corruption is commonplace. Maintaining your legal rights through the courts often means that you have to bear **high legal costs, complex court procedures, unfair judgments by judges who may accept bribes, and the risk that you will still be unable to enforce the judgments**.

In the cyber world, how do we solve these difficult problems that have gone through the  history of mankind but still cannot be solved, and how to create new rules that are more suitable for **crypto residents**?

The decentralized **CyberCourt** system is my answer.

## About CyberCourt

CyberCourt is a **decentralized, process transparent dispute handling system that empowers and restricts the rights of all parties in the form of code**.

The system has three roles, **contract participants, the judge teams, and the platform**.

The following is a detailed explanation of the constraints between the roles.

### Contract participants

The contract participants is the main body of the system. The contract party can sign a project contract with others through the CyberCourt system, pledge the tokens in the smart contract, and select a trusted judge team. After the project is completed, either one of the contract participants can initiate a token distribution proposal. When the contract participants agree upon it , The smart contract will automatically pay the corresponding tokens to the participants according to the content of the proposal.

Through decentralization, contract participants do not need to worry about the security of pledged tokens, and through code restrictions, **ensure that tokens can only be distributed among contractual participants, preventing malicious inflows into addresses associated with the judge team** (Except the handling fee and referee fee of the judge team).

When a dispute arises, either one of the contract participants can apply for refereeing, and a certain number of judge team members can be randomly assigned. After contacting the judge team, the contract participants **submits proof materials**. The judge team will vote on the token distribution proposal according to the situation.

If within the specified time limit, the randomly selected judge fails to vote to complete the proposal, the contract participants may, based on the circumstances, apply for a second assignment of judges to judge. **Considering the special circumstances that the judge team cannot cooperate to complete the referee, the contract participants can apply for token withdrawal**. After the withdrawal  application is submitted, the tokens can be returned to the original account after a period of waiting time.

**The referee timeout time and the waiting time for the withdrawal of tokens** are determined by the judge team, but the contract participants can choose a team of judges that suits them, and these two parameters will remain unchanged after the project is launched.

When the dispute cannot be resolved within the contract participants, the judge team has the right to determine the distribution plan of the tokens, but the judge cannot claim the tokens as their own. **Even in extreme cases, when the judge team does not have enough judges to conduct the trial or the trial is overdue, the contract participants can still apply for token withdrawal to ensure token security**.

It is recommended that **the Buyer check whether the waiting time for withdrawal of tokens is too long before signing the contract**. This will affect the time the tokens are frozen under special circumstances.

It is recommended that **the Seller check whether the waiting time for withdrawal of tokens is reasonable before signing the contract**. If the time is too short, the Seller cannot apply for a referee and pass the proposal within this gap time, and the Buyer may withdraw all the tokens. 

After all of the contract participants signs the project contract, the project enters the execution stage. During the execution process, auxiliary certification materials and supplementary contracts are suggested to be added to the project. The judge will first make a decision based on the information on the chain.

**The Buyer and the Seller of the contract should carefully choose a team of trusted judges together**, instead of being appointed by the Buyer alone, to prevent collusion between the Buyer and the team of judges.

### Judge team

**Anyone can create a judge team**, and each judge team is a DAO organization with one person, one vote. Members of the DAO organization can vote within 3 days to determine the **organization’s name, contact information, website address, referee fees, the number of referees in each case, the number of cases handled by the judges at the same time, and other information, including the distribution of token remuneration and determining the composition of judges, and vote for approval**. After that proposal , it can be executed after 1 day.

When the contract participants cannot resolve the dispute and needs judge, the judge team will randomly select the specified number of judges, and these judges will decide the token distribution plan of the case. When all judges vote and pass the proposal within timeout time, the tokens will be transferred to the corresponding contract participants, and **some of them will enter the judge team in proportion to the referee's fee**.

> **The postponed justice will no longer be justice.** 

If a dispute continues for several years and still cannot be resolved, no matter whether the result of the settlement is fair or not, it will cost each participant a lot of time. So the system uses this mechanism that **when the judger finishes the case quickly，he can accept more cases**. In this way, judges are motivated to deal with disputes more quickly and ,then the time for dispute resolution is reduced.

**The decentralized governance of the judge team will directly determine the future of the team**. How to establish a team’s principle and cultural philosophy, how to distribute profits reasonably, to reward more tokens to people with higher professionalism, and how to eliminate unfair judges will be the core issue of decentralized governance.

It is recommended that the judge team **establish its own website** to publish the principles of handling cases. **Establish a clear and transparent communication system**. Restrict the individual communication between the judge and the contract participant to minimize the possibility of corruption.

It is recommended that the judge team set reasonable parameters, such as the number of judges in each case. When the number of judges is too large, the handling efficiency of the case will be reduced and it is difficult to form a unified opinion; if the number is too small, the corruption risks caused by the judge may increase.When number of cases handled by judges at the same time is too small, the efficiency of the judge will be reduced, and if the number is too large, the judge may not be able to check the cases carefully;

It is recommended that the referee timeout time should be as short as possible when the actual situation allowed, in order to speed up the handling of disputes. The waiting time for withdrawal of tokens is recommended to be about 1.5 times the time of the referee's timeout at least, so that the Seller of the contract has sufficient time for the case to be judged.

All the above parameters should be updated dynamically by the judge team according to the actual situation.

### Platform

The platform is responsible for the construction of Smart Contract, websites, and servers.

**The system is a real decentralized programming design. After the platform is built, the platform will no longer retain any power to upgrade the contract**, preventing the platform from having too much power and creating risks to the contract participants’s pledge of tokens. If there is need to upgrade Smart Contract ,this will be completed by redeploying new smart contract addresses.

The platform does not have the right to suspend the smart contract. Once the smart contract is deployed, as long as it is still used by users, it will run forever in accordance with the contract logic.

The platform only retains the ability to adjust the handling fee, and the handling fee ratio cannot exceed 3%, and the ratio at initial deployment is 0.5%.

Considering that the token model is highly speculative, investors may only want to profit from the ups and downs of the tokens, and cannot promote the real development of the project. **The DAO of the platform will use an incremental reputation system**. The reputation of the members is given by the DAO organization. After the reputation is given, they can participate in the DAO voting governance. In order to speed up the development of the project, the platform should give reputation rewards according to the contribution. 

By default, reputation cannot be transferred, but considering a small part of the actual transfer needs, the DAO organization has the right to vote whether to turn on the switch of reputation transfer.

### CyberCourt's Improvement of Realistic Judicial Rules

**The basic idea behind the establishment of the CyberCourt system is to solidify all processes through code, form clear and transparent processing rules, and grant and restrict the rights of all roles. And through the market selection mechanism of the contract participants to the judge team, after a preiod of time, it is positively motivating the judge team and promoting the judge team to provide more transparent, excellent, professional and fair referees.**

**Now, the CyberCourt world is entrusted to you, and you can start your journey in the cyber world. In the future, what the cyber world will be like depends largely on you. In a sense, you are the founding father of this new continent.**
